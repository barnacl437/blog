4chan got hacked btw.

im not joking lmao. but honestly. I even got the source code from a random forum talking about it.

![showing properties of the "a8z45n.7z" file](https://github.com/barnacl437/webpage/blob/main/pictures/blog/blog-0001.png?raw=true)

it's about nigh 700kB as you can see.

so what's happening with 4chan? well, i'll tell ya...


## for your context...

you already know about 4chan as an imageboard, a barn of controversial opinions, funny but naughy people, and sometimes they do weird things. it's generally the place that people know each other solely by their ID tied to a specific browser session and nothing else, spitting out their purest media macros as the whole meme baking oven of the world, shittalking and stuff. 

I don't visit 4chan that much simply because i don't find myself anything to fit into their very own weird social norms. but i'm glad i've never been into any convos on the platform a single time in my entire life.

but what's hot these days, let's guess my mates...

## public opinions

recently there have been news about 4chan outage experience (yeah, memorable one). searching google really give me these kind of results:

so why is 4chan attacked? the citation below might make things more clarified:

> *The current speculation among users is that 4chan was hacked by an attacker taking advantage of an exploit in an outdated version of PHP that the site still ran on, but we have not been able to verify these rumors.* 
>
> - Mashable, *4chan is down, reportedly hacked as of April 15* <sup>[[1]](https://mashable.com/article/4chan-down-reportedly-hacked)</sup>

well that seems to be a classic in cybersecurity. outdated backend, open firewall, heaps of CVEs, etc. it also makes more sense and is quite presumable that everything behind the popular forum of anonymity are just bunches of 20 year old codes and struggling self-grown servers. 

however even mashable at the time wasn't "able to verify those rumours" citingly, so it was unsure if it was true. 

at the moment 4chan is still down. and there are speculations about leaked source codes and moderators' chat logs. there goes true a whacky fact that hardly any users suffer from this breach, but people behind the forum itself.

According to cyberdaily.au<sup>[[2]](https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/11992-4chan-hack-claimed-by-rival-imageboard-soyjak-party)</sup>, *Soyjak Party* (aka Sharty, the Party), an imageboard competitor, claimed their administration over 4chan. They also leaked the source code, the email of administrators (called janitors or jannies), their irc chats, and MySQL databases.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4chan got hacked by the sharty, they restored /QA/, they leaked the jannies passwords, their IRC, the site is slowing down, this is MASSIVE <a href="https://t.co/Nzpn6rGl5o">pic.twitter.com/Nzpn6rGl5o</a></p>&mdash; Priniz (@Priniz_twt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Priniz_twt/status/1911970751663448290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

As the tweeter say below, the reason behind this is using outdated PHP backend version and old functions in code used to make touch with their SQL DB. I know zero thing about PHP, so that's all I can tell.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So 4chan very likely got hacked because they were running on an extremely out of date version of PHP that has a lot of vulnerabilities and exploits and are using deprecated function to interact with there MySQL database.<br><br>Web security 101: Keep your code and software up to date. <a href="https://t.co/JFDOsbr5rt">pic.twitter.com/JFDOsbr5rt</a></p>&mdash; Yushe (@_yushe) <a href="https://twitter.com/_yushe/status/1912025058953867353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

If you are curious, it is just part of a bigger thread on X/Twitter. Apparently they have never taken a single look on what to do to improve their backend. It's just semantically not updated for ages (since 2016?).

On a Kiwi Farms forum thread<sup>[[3]](https://kiwifarms.st/threads/soyjak-party-the-sharty.145349/page-1467#post-21102686)</sup>, a 7z compressed file of the 4chan backend is posted. I downloaded it and it appears to be safe. Kiwi Farms sounds like also a place for BS and cyber-harassments, so I recommend you not to stay too long on it. The thread on KF is way tldr to read, so we'll skip that aside.

In fact, I do yet know about the motivation of the attack, and what did Soyjak people think about whether 4chan is hackable or not. I will try to find out later when I have time.

This is just the first part of the series. I will write more when it's time to do.
