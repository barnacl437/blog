this is my first post using *eleventy*. 

recently i have been ransacking every way how to write a blog with ease. writing a blog from html was not the efficient way. i dont feel satisfied with using external services that are made end-user-friendly (as they are super lazy ways to do and it's just boring). until i came across *11ty*.

not gonna do <ins>__*real*__</ins> promoting. but to be honest, it works fine. first-time config sounds troublesome at first (as i'm incredibly new to javascript stuff and 11ty itself), but once getting stuff on track, it seems to work wonder (*on my machine*). i don't have to put in every html tag again, just need to keep some markdown syntaxes in mind and chuck them out real fast whenever i need.

as of this time, i am probably trying to finish this article and get eleventy runtime ready for deploying this page. now may i take the chance to test some markdown magics:

# super chunky
## high chunky
### medium chunky
*the leaning tower*

__bold and mold__
