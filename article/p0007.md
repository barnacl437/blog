I currently got on-hand a *Casio fx-580VN X* (which is not mine; it's my little brother's) for helping in doing, say, 
from most basic calculations to solving equations, integral, and calculus stuff in general. 

-----

*If you don't have an idea of what it is, then well: this is probably a region-exclusive, feature-cut(?) version of 
fx-570EX, or anything of similar form. **VN** *probably means* it is purposed for marketing in Vietnam.*

-----

For most of the time, I consider the little boy just a mere tool for doing stuff like those.
It has no I/O ports, no programming support, no internal storage. Only a locked-down low-level
utility. Which is a little piece of boring, well -- it will be banned from exams if it does have those.
