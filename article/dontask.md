title: don't ask to (cause more to) ask

Every now and then, hanging out on *Discord/Revolt/Matrix/XMPP/Signal/etc.*, you may see someone popping up asking at the general chat or some bulletins uttering something similar to the following: 


> AKinkyDude9169: anyone around there?
> AKinkyDude9169: hello?


Well, what a concise opening right? No. It's just too short. Yes. If you are trying to ask for help, there are a heap of reasons many people will *not* choose to throw a look at your message. This is probably what the guy mean:


> AKinkyDude9169: anyone around here willing to hear me out on this problem im having so that i can reckon a way to solve it?


or rewrite it to suit your need. Please at least add something detailed if you at least want people to engage in the convo in the first place. If you feel too lazy to try asking adequately, then there might be no reason people will likely try to help you. Don't cause more questions to the convo. Don't raise more scepticism in whether what your purpose is. It might waste more of your time, or other's time.

So, short as said, don't ask to (cause more to) ask. Just ask. That's it.

This is greatly paraphrased in a non programming context so that it will not look like a blatant copy.*

username is just for fun, not a reference to any real person. if it happens, it is 100% a coincidence. trust me mates.
