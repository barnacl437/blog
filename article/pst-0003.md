like. how the fuck are they exaggeratingly applying mobile layout to desktop view?
this is a Vietnamese website about an idle money-earning mobile app. and they made the website exclusively mobile-friendly.

i feel pathetic for some low effort web designs, especially made by rude and poorly-arsed companies. Didn't mean to insult any real people, but rather than that, I highly criticise the spirit behind them.

well, i know i am a no-better. but say, they must be some enterprises doing business, at least please make your website, ***if not your products***, universally optimised for all kind of devices. Accessibility is the key to success.

btw, i'd like to boast out some unpopular opinions about Vietnamese companies working in online fields.

if you don't know, there are some Vietnamese game publishers (VTC Games, Gamota, etc.) which import and do localisation works for numerous games, mainly from China, and from various shovelware YouTube ads you might probably have seen. Though in fact, most of them do that, most of the time.

Most of them are advertised the same way: publicly giving giftcodes, showcasing gameplay, sometimes failed game deliberately shown (i.e. to play the game then at some point they go a wrong move and, well, oopsie). This is possibly made to trigger viewers' itch, in order to have them download and play. I know them too well.

For the typical scheme of giftcodes and in-game currency, I can best describe using this following statement: the [Great Depression of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression).

Why? They are dumb brats actually thinking that giving more level-up chances and a lot of money (to upgrade their skills and gears) to players will make them addict to their games. In fact, if they already know how market works, they should know that all of them are just turning their games to be landfills right? No. They don't fucking care lol.

    I can't find this ad anymore, but I've seen an ad that says "there should be a game that is easy to play for busy people (who have very tight free times)". How the fuck would you just target busy people? What is your point on this? I can't fucking get a clue on your yap.

Yes. These are things you'll get. I know most of you won't care anyways, but I do. lmao i just don't like them. They're all worth being dumped. But I'm sure you can see these kind of game ads in your country too. I'm like 101% sure about that.

My tips for encountering these: stay away from 'em as far as possible. They are made by idle people with their purposes going to nowhere. With excessively poor quality and trivial support, these games are made to die really fast. No real fan base, no real passionate. When they die, no one shall remember. Such shall just go to Dante's eighth circle of hell.

A really sad fact about Vietnamese game industry is that, a substantial portion of the field are being made out of fair dunkum garbages, only to help their publishers earn short-term revenues. This business model have to end soon. I want them to cook the different but more brilliant way.
