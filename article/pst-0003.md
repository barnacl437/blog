title: spectacular 4chan breach (and leak)? (part 2)

Continuing [the last post](/pst-0002), I will tell what I already know about the 4chan security breach, and some of the internet traces I will bring on here.

This is the construction of the PHP source code that we already know.

![](https://github.com/barnacl437/Barnacl437/blob/main/misc/pic-hoster/blog/pic0003.png?raw=true)

`yotsuba_config.php` is the caretaker of the whole PHP app. It is the main source file to be run, and the imageboard itself.

```php
	require_once 'lib/ini.php';
	// Yotsuba configuration engine
	// HOEHOEPA!
```

no idea much about the comments, but i'm sure it's like... something funny?
