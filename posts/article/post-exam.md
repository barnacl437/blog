> also, from this post, i'll name *the article files* (shown on url) the different way--not using the numbers anymore,
but a (sometimes subtracted) corresponding title. it would be a fuss to remember which number
was for the last post, and sometimes numeral skippers may occur.

i don't have much idea what topic i'd write for my blog recently (pretty much the
 [writer's block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block) symptom), so sometimes
 a good break could be beneficial. it's already very late in the night now, so i'll tell about my
 situation real quick.

 i'm better from GORD now. my performance at the graduation exam wasn't anywhere close to
excellence, but at least i came thru it. that's it.

see you in the very next time. i'll manage to cope with infosec (at least that's what i plan to
 major when entering uni).
