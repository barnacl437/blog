g'day the internet.

it's me. this is a quick post that i want to write now.

as the days are passing by, i wonder what will i be going to do.

i plan to learn how to code when i enter university. well, as a 12th grade senior high student. i have been really lazy when i come to learn stuff when i have some free time. 

yeah it sounds too bad. anyways, still thinking much about what major will i attend.

there are not many but some routes for me to choose: pedagogy, linguist or loosely, IT. 
The last two are what arose from my lil' passion and/or hobbies. 
But as a math sucker + currently largely illiterated in major programming languages, my family, esp. 
my father, has been skeptical about my real aptitude in attending serious IT majors like computer science or such. 

Of course while i still can help him in daily stuff like how to use an app, general fixes, etc., up to now all the best I can do is probably familiar windows batch script commands or some knowledge about html/css, and basic python functions.

so...

## now what?

yes, this is the question i am longing to find a true answer.

what will i do after quitting high school? well... still thinking. for now.

stay tuned for the [***now what? 2*** ] where i will have more to tell.
